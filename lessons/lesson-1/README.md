The first document


1. open TexStudio
2. Create a new document from templates:
i.e.:
`File->New ->New From Template -> Scrlttr`

3. Press <img src="https://www.wpclipart.com/signs_symbol/arrows/button_arrows/play_buttons/fast_forward_button.png" width="20" height="20" />
to create the document

If you see now a blank white page: congratulations
you installed latex.

 * It's pronounced: /ˈlɑːtɛx/ (LAH-tekh)
 
 * You have to correct people who mispronounce or 	misspell it
