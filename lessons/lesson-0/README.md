## Install the "Latex Stuff"
Before we can dive into the fun of creating our own latex documents, we need to install a *distribution* and an *editor* on our computer.

Be aware there is differet editors and distrebutions out there.
For this corse I recomment the following, mainly because I use them.



Distribution:
[MikTex](https://miktex.org/download)
Editor
[TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/).

```
1. Dowload MikTex and TexStudio
2. Install MikTex
3. Install TexStudio
```
