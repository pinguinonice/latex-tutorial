## Install the "Latex Stuff"
Before we can dive into the fun of creating our own latex documents, we need to install a *distribution* and an *editor* on our computer.

Be aware there is different editors and distributions out there.
For this courses I recomment the following, mainly because I use them.



Distribution:
[MikTex](https://miktex.org/download)
Editor
[TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/).

#### How to install

1. Dowload MikTex and TexStudio
2. Install MikTex
3. Install TexStudio


## Crete your first document


1. open TexStudio
2. Create a new document from templates:
i.e.:
`File->New ->New From Template -> Scrlttr`

3. Press <img src="https://www.wpclipart.com/signs_symbol/arrows/button_arrows/play_buttons/fast_forward_button.png" width="20" height="20" />
to create the document

If you see now a blank white page: congratulations
you installed latex.

## Be pro
Since you basically are  a latex pro now, you can start to behave like one:

 * It's spelled LaTeX
 
 * It's pronounced: /ˈlɑːtɛx/ (LAH-tekh)
 
 * You can correct people who mispronounce or 	misspell it
